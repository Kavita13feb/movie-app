# Movie List Application

This is a responsive, mobile-first web application built with React that fetches and displays a list of movies from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. Users can search for movies, filter them by genres, release year range, and rating range, and use infinite scrolling to view more movies as they scroll down. The application also includes a fixed button that scrolls the page to the top when clicked.
